# Winogrande_CHATGPT
The evaluation of Winogrande Debiased Validation set on ChatGPT

So far I could found the chance to ask for 90 samples and hit the limits. I will continue whenever I have access again.

Sometimes the model answers like **Option1: Answer**, and sometimes it only responds with a single number.

Here is the generic text:

```
Choose the option that is a better fit for the gap in the sentence. Do not explain. Only say 1 or 2
Sentence : {}
    
Option1 : {}
Option2 : {}
```

The accuracy over 90 samples: %65.5

I will update this page regularly.
